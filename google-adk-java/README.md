# AI Agent POC ‚Äì Java Example Using ADK

This repository contains a proof-of-concept (POC) implementation of a Java agent built with the **Google ADK SDK**, following the ["Get Started" Java tutorial](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/get-started/java/).  
The goal is to explore **agent SDK behaviors**, documentation quality, and integration patterns across multiple frameworks.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21**
- **Maven**

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone this repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bhmgbrca/ai-agent-poc.git
    cd ai-agent-poc
    ```

2. **Create a Google API Key**

    - Visit [Google AI Studio ‚Äì API Keys](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
    - Click **‚ÄúCreate API Key‚Äù**
    - Copy the generated key ‚Äî it will be used to authenticate your ADK requests.
    - Keep it secure and **never commit it to Git**.
   

3. **Set your Google API Key**

   Create a `.env` file containing your API key:

    ```bash
    echo 'export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"' > .env
    ```

   Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` with your actual Google API key.  
   This environment variable will be used by the agent to authenticate with Google ADK.

   **Remember to load keys and settings: source .env OR env.bat**


3. **Run the example agent**

    ```bash
    mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.example.agent.AgentCliRunner"
    ```
   or
   
    ```bash
    mvn compile exec:java \
    -Dexec.mainClass="com.google.adk.web.AdkWebServer" \
    -Dexec.args="--adk.agents.source-dir=target --server.port=8000"
    ```

## üìÑ What's Included

- Implementation of the **Google ADK Java "Get Started"** example
- Clean project structure and configuration (`pom.xml`)
- Minor adjustments to align with standard project conventions
- A foundation for exploring:
    - Agent behavior and context management
    - SDK integration approaches
    - Documentation quality comparisons

---

## üéØ Purpose

This POC aims to:

- Validate the setup and execution of the **Google ADK Java** example
- Provide a foundation for experimentation with other **AI SDKs and agent frameworks**
- Serve as a baseline for evaluating developer experience, SDK API design, and integration ergonomics
- Test different uses of the instructions
